# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description 
This assignment was to refactor the html and css for the Horiseon company webpage. Both codes needed serious semantic and strutural reorganization, as well as the addition of accessibility features in order to comply with standards.

## Issues

### HTML
First, changed the title in <head> to read "Horiseon" when page is open.
Began with header/footer and adjusted elements to meet html semantic expectations. In addition, I changed the identifiers for many elements on the page to have more clear, organized, and understandable names. I then made sure the navigation elements in the header were in an unorder list as well as functioning properly/had appropriate id's.
