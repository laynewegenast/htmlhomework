# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description 
This assignment was to refactor the html and css for the Horiseon company webpage. Both files needed serious semantic and strutural reorganization, as well as the addition of accessibility features in order to comply with standards.

## Issues

### HTML
First, changed the title in <head> to read "Horiseon" when page is open.
Began with header/footer and adjusted elements to meet html semantic expectations. In addition, I changed the identifiers for many elements on the page to have more clear, organized, and understandable names. I then made sure the navigation elements in the header were in an unorder list as well as functioning properly/had appropriate id's.

I also added "alt" texts to all of the images on the page to meet accessibility standards, although alt is left blank in all images because they are decorative and not crucial to the understanding of the page. In addition, comments were also added within the html file to create a more comprehensive and organized structure.

### CSS
Condensed "benefits" css style by consolidating classes in both services and benefits sections. This was able to reduce the number of style commands in the css file. I also restructed the css file so that sections/elements would be grouped together in a more coherent way. Organizational comments were made within the css file to outline where certain elements/sections styles begin and end.
